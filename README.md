Welcome to the Project Repository!

This repository contains the source code and resources for Around The World, a website dedicated to fans of the legendary band Red Hot Chilie Peppers. The site has been developed with a focus on user experience and is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for smooth navigation on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The site was primarily built with HTML for a robust structure and styled with CSS for an engaging visual experience. You can acess the website through the following link: https://gabrielfc98.github.io/Arount-The-World/

<h2>Towards the end of this README file, you'll find images of how the site appears on tablets and smartphones, showcasing its responsive design.</h2>
Around the world has 3 main areas on each page: Sidenav, Content, Advert.

Sidenav -> Effortless navigation is provided, allowing you to seamlessly explore additional pages on the site, each offering unique content dedicated to individual members of the band.
Content -> Main area of wich page where you can discover the history and other informations about all the band members. 
Advert -> An area of the website is dedicated to advertisements. These advertisements are fictional and will guide you to other projects that I've created.
